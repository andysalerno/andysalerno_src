# Part 2: Reading smarter with AsyncLineBuffer

The "hello world" ToyGrep from Part 1 was reasonably speedy for smaller files, but struggled with larger files. And worst of all, it used O(n) memory on the size of the file, loading the entire file into memory, which is absolutely not desirable.

It would be much smarter to have a sliding-window buffer that scans across the file, limiting the amount of memory used at any given time.

(It would also be possible to use memory maps, which Ripgrep will sometimes do based upon the scenario, but to remain simple, the line buffer is adequate for nearly all scenarios.)

Creating a file-reading buffer for regex line searching is not as simple as you might first guess.

The happiest scenario is trivial: you populate your buffer, and it contains a whole line, and you match the line with regex and handle the result.

But what if you populate the buffer, and it contains the first half of a line, but not the second? You can't run your match on half the line.

Or, if you're reading raw bytes from a utf-8 stream, and your content includes multi-byte characters, what if your buffer cuts off part of a character? ðŸ˜¢ 

You need some type of line-aware buffer, that knows how many complete and incomplete lines it contains, and which can grow to fit a whole line if it needs to.

In Toygrep, this is handled by `AsyncLineBuffer`.

### AsyncLineBuffer

Toygrep's `AsyncLineBuffer` is modeled after [Ripgrep's `LineBuffer`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/grep-searcher/src/line_buffer.rs), with one or two simplifications.

The `AsyncLineBuffer` wraps the underlying byte buffer, and handles the primitive behavior of the buffer, such as filling itself from a source and keeping track of its state. It exposes no public fields or methods outside of its crate. It is constructed via a simple `AsyncLineBufferBuilder`.

Another type, `AsyncLineBufferReader`, will hold the `AsyncLineBuffer` and expose the interesting functionality: `read_line()`.

Let's use a visual representation of AsyncLineBuffer to understand how it works.

#### Visual example

At the lowest level, the buffer is a vector of bytes in memory, owned by the `AsyncLineBuffer`.

We're going to additionally imagine that this vector in memory is split into three chunks.

For simplicity, let's call the chunks the **consumed** chunk, the **working** chunk, and the **remaining** chunk.

For example, our buffer in memory may look like this:
```
buffer:
    [___hello.\n______] (len 16)
   start^       ^end
```

The **consumed** chunk is everything before `start`; the **working** chunk is from `start` until `end`, and the **remaining** chunk is from `end` to the end of the buffer. (In the above example, values outside the **working** chunk are shown as `_` for simplicity, but will be "real" values in practice.)

A psuedo-code explanation of the algorithm that powers `AsyncBufferReader::read_line()` is like this:

```
while there are no completed lines in the buffer:
    roll the buffer to the front (explained later).
    if the 'remaining' chunk is length 0, grow the buffer.
    read into the 'remaining' chunk until it is totally full or the source is exhausted.
    advance the 'working' chunk bounds to include everything we just read into 'remaining'.

get a slice of the next available line in the buffer.
advance the 'consumed' chunk bounds to include that line.
return the slice.
```

#### Example 1: Happy path

Assume this is the starting state of the buffer:

```
buffer:
    [________________] (len 16)
start^end

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

We ask the `AsyncBufferReader` to `read_line()`.

The `AsyncLineBufferReader` asks the `AsyncLineBuffer` if it has any lines ready for us (i.e. is there any terminal line position in `line_break_idxs`.)

The `AsyncLineBuffer` says "No."


The declaration of `fill` looks like this:

```rust
async fn fill<R>(&mut self, mut reader: R) -> bool
    where
        R: async_std::io::Read + std::marker::Unpin,
```

Let's say the source we are reading from has this content:

```
Hello.\n
```

The buffer will be in this state after it `fill`s itself:

```
buffer:
    [Hello.\n_________] (len 16)
start^       ^end

line_break_idxs:
[6]
```

It read from the source into the byte vector, then scanned for any line breaks in the content, and found one at index `6`, so it pushed `6` into the queue of `line_break_idxs`.

The `AsyncLineBufferReader` exposes `read_line()`, with a declaration like this:

```Rust
async fn read_line<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<LineResult<'a>>;
```

As described in the psuedo-code earlier, when the owner calls `read_line()`, the buffer reader will call `fill()` on its buffer until it contains at least one line, which we can detect if there's any value(s) in `line_break_idxs`, or until the source is exhausted.

It then returns a `LineResult`, which looks like this:

```Rust
struct LineResult<'a> {
    line_num: usize,
    text: &'a [u8],
}
```

`text` is a reference is to the slice in the buffer that holds the line.

To get this reference, the buffer reader invokes `consume_line()` on the buffer, which looks like this:
```Rust
fn consume_line(&mut self) -> Option<&[u8]> {
    if let Some(line_break_pos) = self.line_break_idxs.pop_back() {
        // inclusive range to include the linebreak itself.
        let line = &self.buffer[self.start..=line_break_pos];
        self.start += line.len();

        Some(line)
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Our buffer now looks like this:
```
buffer:
    [Hello.\n_________] (len 16)
        start^end

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

Note that the original content `Hello\n` didn't go anywhere. It's still there, taking up space in our byte buffer. We've simply updated the `start` position to make all operations in our buffer "start" after the consumed portion.


#### Example 2: Overflow

Let's see what happens when the content we're reading from can't fit entirely in the buffer.

This is the content of our source:

```
Leave the gun.\n
Take the cannoli.\n
```

We are starting with a totally unused buffer:
```
buffer:
    [________________] (len 16)
start^end

line_break_idxs:
[]
```
We ask the buffer reader to please `read_line()`.

The buffer reader sees there are no lines in the buffer, so it asks the buffer to please `fill()` itself.

The buffer reads as much as it can from the source into its byte vector in the **remaining** chunk.

(Since we started with a brand new buffer, the **remaining** chunk is the entire buffer.)

This is the result:

```
buffer:
    [Leave the gun.\nT] (len 16)
start^                ^end

line_break_idxs:
[14]
```

The buffer reader checks to see if we have any full lines now.

We do!

So just like in the first example, we call `consume_line()` on the buffer to get back a `LineResult`, which contains a slice reference to the portion: `Leave the gun.\n`. The buffer state now looks like this:

```Rust
buffer:
    [Leave the gun.\nT] (len 16)
                start^^end

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

Cool. We ask the buffer reader to give us the next line.

And things get interesting.

I didn't mention this before, but whenever we ask the buffer to `fill()`, it first checks to see if we should roll the contents back to the start.

What does this mean? If the buffer contains any already-consumed lines (i.e. has a non-zero `start` value), we can regain some space by sliding `start` back to zero. 

We call `roll_to_front()`, which copies everything in the `start` to `end` portion of the buffer to the front of the buffer, resulting in this state:
```Rust
buffer:
    [Teave the gun.\nT] (len 16)
start^^end

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

This is actually one of the most important details of Ripgrep and Toygrep's implementations, and a very valuable lesson I learned from Ripgrep regarding performance.

As a programmer, it's easy to get stuck in the mindset that "copying == bad". Why should I spend so much time copying data from one side of a memory buffer to another? If you're like me, your first intuition might be something like this instead:

- When we find a complete line, instead of returning a borrowed slice into the buffer, split the buffer in-place at the linebreak and return an owning vector of the line.
- The `start` position of the buffer is now back at `0`, since we split off everything before it.

Or, visually, do this:
```Rust
buffer:
    [Leave the gun.\n][T] (len 1)
                      ^split vector here, in place
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^you get this whole chunk back, as an owned vec
                      ^my inner buffer now starts here

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

Now the caller gets ownership of the line, and the next time you ask the buffer reader to hand you a line, the buffer will simply resize itself to some minimum amount of space:
```Rust
buffer:
    [Leave the gun.\n][Take the cannoli] (len 16)
                      ^split vector here, in place
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^you get this whole chunk back, as an owned vec
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^my next read expands the vector back to size 16 and populates it from the source

line_break_idxs:
[]
```

This was how my first implementation worked, since it seems the most obvious: when you ask to consume a line, obviously I should pass ownership of it to you, right? It's yours now.

Let's compare performance of these two strategies.
