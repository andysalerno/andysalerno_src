## Step 1: The spark ignites

Oooh, look at this cool person's blog post that was posted on Hacker News... Why don't I have cool, minimal blog like this?

## Step 2: Pick your theme

Spend two hours browsing minimal [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) until you find one that's simple yet functional.

## Step 3: Simplify

Why does this "simple" theme include google analytics and disqus?

I should gut it of all the stuff I don't need...

## Step 4: Doubt

Do I really have anything interesting to say, anyway? Is there a point to all this?

## Step 5: Persevere

No, you must do this, or you're not a Real Developer.

## Step 6: Publish

"Here's a neat thing I learned about Rust..."

## Step 7: Abandon
